================================================================================

- Many pages use URL parameters (e.g., ?emotions=...) to pass state between pages
- Tooltips are used throughout for additional context
- PDF worksheets are linked from many skill pages (marked with "(pdf)" in titles)
- Mobile and desktop layouts differ (buttons are fixed on desktop, in-flow on mobile)
- The flowchart is the primary interactive pathway, while category pages allow direct access to specific skills
